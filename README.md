# The Creative Muse Chatbot

A multi-modal AI brainstorming partner designed to overcome creative blocks. It transforms text, images, and audio into narrative concepts, visual prompts, and soundscapes.

## Features

* **Creative Synthesis:** Uses a local Mistral 7B model to generate avant-garde plot twists and ideas.
* **Provocative Mode:** Includes a "Challenge Mode" that forces users to refine their ideas with constraints.
* **Multi-Format Output:** Generates Story Concepts, Midjourney/DALL-E Prompts, and Music Cues.
